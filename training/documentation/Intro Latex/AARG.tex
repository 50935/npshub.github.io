\begin{enumerate}
	\bf 
\item \color{red}  How can we start our goal?
First, starting from minor works like discussing weekly or monthly specific
collaborative or individual research work papers via webinar. i.e. paper
presentation. That means engaging in regular talks (Main emphasis).
\item \color{blue} Concept of professional society of Astrophysics and Cosmology in Nepal
that can manage education, research and collaboration.
\item \color{red} Have to fully focus on research based programs i.e. our plan should be
directed on research.
\item \color{blue}How can we fulfill the gap between senior and young researchers?
